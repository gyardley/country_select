Preamble
========

This version of Michael Koziarski's CountrySelect has been modified and packaged as a gem. The list of countries no longer matches the ISO 3166 standard. 

(The choices I have made will also offend some users. You should decide on your own country list, tailored for your own audience.)

Since I don't know what I'm supposed to do with previous README files, I've left an earlier README below.

CountrySelect
=============

Provides a simple helper to get an HTML select list of countries.  The list of countries comes from the ISO 3166 standard.  While it is a relatively neutral source of country names, it will still offend some users.

Users are strongly advised to evaluate the suitability of this list given their user base.

## Installation

Install as a gem using

    gem install country-select

Or put the following in your Gemfile

    gem 'country-select'

## Example

Simple use supplying model and attribute as parameters:

    country_select("user", "country_name")

Supplying priority countries to be placed at the top of the list:

    country_select("user", "country_name", [ "United Kingdom", "France", "Germany" ])

Specifying which country to be selected:
United Kingdom will be selected.
country_select("user", "country_name", [ "+United Kingdom+", "France", "Germany" ])

Example in a Rails form:
Full list, with New Zealand Australia and United Kingdom prioritized (New Zealand selected
by default)
<%= country_select(:player, :nationality, [ "+New Zealand+", "Australia", "United Kingdom" ])
%>
